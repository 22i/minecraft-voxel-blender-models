to make the model textures clearer in blender check the upper left - file - user preferences... <br /> on the system tab uncheck Mipmaps, set Anisotropic Filtering to Off and save user settings button in the lower left.

When exporting dont forget to be in object mode and press SHIFT-C<br />- double press A to select everything then press SHIFT-CTRL-ALT-C origin to 3D cursor<br />- press 7 to switch to top view rotate with R for 180 degress CTRL-J to join all the objects together<br />- test animation by pressing ALT-A and export using [special minetest B3D exporter](https://github.com/minetest/B3Dexport)

when exporting mobs that hold items like: zombie pigman. baby zombie pigman, vex, skeleton, stray, wither skeleton, illusioner and vindicator you have a choice between minecraft default item or pixel perfection item. If you want pp then delete the other holdable item without pp in the name.

if something is off or some cube is in wrong location like wither, enderdragon, wolf and skeleton reopen that .blend skip origin to 3D cursor part and put model into middle manualy
